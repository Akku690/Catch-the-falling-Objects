The "Catch the Falling Objects" project is an interactive web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control a player (or catcher) that moves horizontally at the bottom of the screen to catch falling objects. The game is designed to be engaging and fun, providing a simple yet challenging experience for players of all ages.



Technical Implementation:

HTML: The structure of the game is built using HTML, which includes a canvas element for rendering the game graphics, as well as div elements for displaying the score and lives.

CSS: The styling is done using CSS, which provides the layout, colors, and overall visual appeal of the game. It includes styles for the game container, scoreboard, and game over message.

JavaScript: The game logic is implemented in JavaScript. 
It handles:

The movement of the catcher based on user input.
The spawning and updating of falling objects.
Collision detection to determine if the player catches an object.
The game loop that continuously updates the game state and renders graphics on the canvas.
